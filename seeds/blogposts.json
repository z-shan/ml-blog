Seriously Iâ€™m not kidding. These things sell out within minutes every time they go on sale, and after missing out a few times I decided to take things a bit more seriouslyâ€¦â€¦ I fired up 3 devices and filled up my basket on each one in order to snag myself some of these highly lusted after lipsticks. Following a very tense 10 minutes or so I managed to bag myself Candy K, Kourt K and a Kylie Cosmetic lip gloss in the shade â€œLiterallyâ€. My Snapchat followers saw it all in action and were probably deafened by my squeals after my order was accepted and went through!\nOnce the Lip Kits arrived I felt that as I put so much into getting these beauties that I really should write a post on them, but I didnâ€™t want to write a standard review as Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve all read many of them by now. So instead Iâ€™ve decided to give you my thoughts on the Kylie Cosmetic Lip Kit versus some other highly popular liquid lipsticks â€“Â Anastasia Beverly Hills. So here we goâ€¦â€¦.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","__v":0,"comments":[],"tags":["fashion", "makeup", "trendy", "kylie", "anastasia"]},

Say what you will about the ingredient list of its namesake soft drink, but thereâ€™s no denying how hard the brand works to uphold its status as a household name.\nTheir formula for success? A knack for heart-warming ads (think, â€œIâ€™d Like to Buy the World a Cokeâ€), and they tugged at our heartstrings again in their 2014 Super Bowl spot, â€œItâ€™s Beautiful.â€\nIn the one-minute clip, â€œAmerica the Beautifulâ€ is sung in nine different languages â€“ English, Spanish, Tagalog, Mandarin, Hindi, Hebrew, Keres, French, and Arabic. It celebrated what makes America (and the brand) so great: Its diversity.\nHowever, this fusion of Coca-Colaâ€™s American roots and globalization didnâ€™t sit well with some conservative consumers. â€œThis is America, we speak English,â€ shouted someone on Twitter, while others simply tweeted the brand, â€œWTF?â€\nBut the carbonated beverage actually saw incredible returns: In the days following, Coca-Colaâ€™s YouTube subscriber count grew more than 1,100 percent while generating more than 50,000 likes on other social platforms.\nSo what ignited the spike? A traditionally American song sung in multiple languages added just the right amount of controversy to the brandâ€™s more vanilla formula.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","__v":0,"comments":[],"tags":["brands","marketing","strategy"]},

They promise to reinvent everything from cars to thermostats to contact lenses. Yet in a sign of how innovation is stalling broadly in the American economy, they are finding their new terrain far harder to control than their familiar digital turf.\n\nAlphabetâ€™s 58 self-driving cars have traveled 2.2 million miles, but they are still flummoxed by snow and drive so conservatively they can disrupt traffic. Its high-altitude balloons designed to beam internet to remote areas have sometimes crashed in shreds, baffling engineers. A planned interactive jacket was delayed for a year in part because its sensor-embedded threads snapped under the pull of industrial looms. The tech giant abandoned projects involving cargo blimps, vertical farming and seawater-to-fuel technology that proved too difficult or expensive.\n\nOthers face similar problems. Facebook Inc. is struggling to launch solar-powered drones to beam internet connections via lasers. Starship Technologies, led by a co-founder of video-chat service Skype, plans a fleet of delivery robots, but current models use human operators to cross a road.\n\nIn software, programmers can control their environment. The physical world is messy and unpredictable. Even the smartest computers canâ€™t prepare for every possibility. Add to that the burden of public safety and regulation and it is easy to see why the tech industry hasnâ€™t been able to replicate its success in the digital realm.\n\nâ€œThe world is so unforgiving. You canâ€™t just ask it to be more organized,â€ said Astro Teller, the ponytailed chief of X, Alphabetâ€™s research lab that has investigatedâ€”and decided againstâ€”space elevators and jetpacks.\n\nMoreover, digital progress is rapid, because computing power increases dramatically over time and software can be replicated endlessly. In the physical world, advances are constrained by physics.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"John Doe","__v":0,"comments":[],"tags":["software","silicon valley"]},

Kylieâ€™s work has been met with great success, but her cosmetic undertaking has certainly been the center of attention since its inception late last year.\n\nThereâ€™s suddenly a new elephant in the room of marketing discussionsâ€”how the heck is Kylie generating so much hype and selling so much product?\n\nAs we like to say around here at Top Hat, weâ€™re not the type to let the elephant in the room sit there without introducing it, inviting it to sit at the meeting table and giving it a heaping cup of coffee. So hereâ€™s a look at the Lip Kit Craze and my theory on what built its marketing success.\n\nTHE LIP KIT CRAZE\n\nIn November 2015, Kylie Jenner released three matte lip kits and the world went crazy. The demand was so high that all three kits sold out in one minute, causing the site to momentarily crashâ€”something that any cosmetic brand dreams about.\n\nSince then, Kylie Cosmetics came to be and new products have been added to the repertoire. Recent interviews with the socialite have been focused on her astounding success and her plans for future projects. Kylie has mentioned on more than one occasion that she has plans to expand her cosmetic career and to ultimately focus on more behind-the-scenes projects.\n\nEach member of the Kardashian/Jenner family has found their niche and they own it. Kylie is no exception. Whatever she puts her name on, it sells, but I have to wonder what is it that makes this young lady such a cultural phenomenon and what we can take away.\n\nFAMILY NAME OR SOMETHING ELSE?\nMany people are quick to assume that it has to do with her family name. I would have to agree to some point that is certainly doesnâ€™t hurt her career any by being a Jenner, but she works hard and the proof is in the pudding. There have been many instances in which a celebrity attempts to break out on their own and they fail. Something tells me the Kylie Jenner name isnâ€™t going anywhere.\n\nSo, what is it that Kylie does differently from other people in her field? She hires the right people and does the right things. Yes, her fanbase is large and they are devoted, but that doesnâ€™t always cut it when it comes to selling products.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","__v":1,"comments":[{"content":"Kylie phenomenon.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author": "John Doe","datetime":"2017-07-30T06:48:26.765Z","_id":"597d813a09ffe7b4c31d2010"}],"tags":["fashion","kylie","marketing","strategy"]}
