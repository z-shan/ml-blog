Seriously Iâ€™m not kidding. These things sell out within minutes every time they go on sale, and after missing out a few times I decided to take things a bit more seriouslyâ€¦â€¦ I fired up 3 devices and filled up my basket on each one in order to snag myself some of these highly lusted after lipsticks. Following a very tense 10 minutes or so I managed to bag myself Candy K, Kourt K and a Kylie Cosmetic lip gloss in the shade â€œLiterallyâ€. My Snapchat followers saw it all in action and were probably deafened by my squeals after my order was accepted and went through!\nOnce the Lip Kits arrived I felt that as I put so much into getting these beauties that I really should write a post on them, but I didnâ€™t want to write a standard review as Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve all read many of them by now. So instead Iâ€™ve decided to give you my thoughts on the Kylie Cosmetic Lip Kit versus some other highly popular liquid lipsticks â€“Â Anastasia Beverly Hills. So here we goâ€¦â€¦.","username":"xyz1@gmail.com","author":"Sam Sation","comments":[],"tags":["fashion", "makeup", "trendy", "kylie", "anastasia"]},

Say what you will about the ingredient list of its namesake soft drink, but thereâ€™s no denying how hard the brand works to uphold its status as a household name.\nTheir formula for success? A knack for heart-warming ads (think, â€œIâ€™d Like to Buy the World a Cokeâ€), and they tugged at our heartstrings again in their 2014 Super Bowl spot, â€œItâ€™s Beautiful.â€\nIn the one-minute clip, â€œAmerica the Beautifulâ€ is sung in nine different languages â€“ English, Spanish, Tagalog, Mandarin, Hindi, Hebrew, Keres, French, and Arabic. It celebrated what makes America (and the brand) so great: Its diversity.\nHowever, this fusion of Coca-Colaâ€™s American roots and globalization didnâ€™t sit well with some conservative consumers. â€œThis is America, we speak English,â€ shouted someone on Twitter, while others simply tweeted the brand, â€œWTF?â€\nBut the carbonated beverage actually saw incredible returns: In the days following, Coca-Colaâ€™s YouTube subscriber count grew more than 1,100 percent while generating more than 50,000 likes on other social platforms.\nSo what ignited the spike? A traditionally American song sung in multiple languages added just the right amount of controversy to the brandâ€™s more vanilla formula.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","comments":[],"tags":["brands","marketing","strategy"]},

They promise to reinvent everything from cars to thermostats to contact lenses. Yet in a sign of how innovation is stalling broadly in the American economy, they are finding their new terrain far harder to control than their familiar digital turf.\n\nAlphabetâ€™s 58 self-driving cars have traveled 2.2 million miles, but they are still flummoxed by snow and drive so conservatively they can disrupt traffic. Its high-altitude balloons designed to beam internet to remote areas have sometimes crashed in shreds, baffling engineers. A planned interactive jacket was delayed for a year in part because its sensor-embedded threads snapped under the pull of industrial looms. The tech giant abandoned projects involving cargo blimps, vertical farming and seawater-to-fuel technology that proved too difficult or expensive.\n\nOthers face similar problems. Facebook Inc. is struggling to launch solar-powered drones to beam internet connections via lasers. Starship Technologies, led by a co-founder of video-chat service Skype, plans a fleet of delivery robots, but current models use human operators to cross a road.\n\nIn software, programmers can control their environment. The physical world is messy and unpredictable. Even the smartest computers canâ€™t prepare for every possibility. Add to that the burden of public safety and regulation and it is easy to see why the tech industry hasnâ€™t been able to replicate its success in the digital realm.\n\nâ€œThe world is so unforgiving. You canâ€™t just ask it to be more organized,â€ said Astro Teller, the ponytailed chief of X, Alphabetâ€™s research lab that has investigatedâ€”and decided againstâ€”space elevators and jetpacks.\n\nMoreover, digital progress is rapid, because computing power increases dramatically over time and software can be replicated endlessly. In the physical world, advances are constrained by physics.","username":"xyz2@gmail.com","author":"John Doe","comments":[],"tags":["software","silicon valley"]},

Kylieâ€™s work has been met with great success, but her cosmetic undertaking has certainly been the center of attention since its inception late last year.\n\nThereâ€™s suddenly a new elephant in the room of marketing discussionsâ€”how the heck is Kylie generating so much hype and selling so much product?\n\nAs we like to say around here at Top Hat, weâ€™re not the type to let the elephant in the room sit there without introducing it, inviting it to sit at the meeting table and giving it a heaping cup of coffee. So hereâ€™s a look at the Lip Kit Craze and my theory on what built its marketing success.\n\nTHE LIP KIT CRAZE\n\nIn November 2015, Kylie Jenner released three matte lip kits and the world went crazy. The demand was so high that all three kits sold out in one minute, causing the site to momentarily crashâ€”something that any cosmetic brand dreams about.\n\nSince then, Kylie Cosmetics came to be and new products have been added to the repertoire. Recent interviews with the socialite have been focused on her astounding success and her plans for future projects. Kylie has mentioned on more than one occasion that she has plans to expand her cosmetic career and to ultimately focus on more behind-the-scenes projects.\n\nEach member of the Kardashian/Jenner family has found their niche and they own it. Kylie is no exception. Whatever she puts her name on, it sells, but I have to wonder what is it that makes this young lady such a cultural phenomenon and what we can take away.\n\nFAMILY NAME OR SOMETHING ELSE?\nMany people are quick to assume that it has to do with her family name. I would have to agree to some point that is certainly doesnâ€™t hurt her career any by being a Jenner, but she works hard and the proof is in the pudding. There have been many instances in which a celebrity attempts to break out on their own and they fail. Something tells me the Kylie Jenner name isnâ€™t going anywhere.\n\nSo, what is it that Kylie does differently from other people in her field? She hires the right people and does the right things. Yes, her fanbase is large and they are devoted, but that doesnâ€™t always cut it when it comes to selling products.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","comments":[{"content":"Kylie phenomenon.","username":"xyz2@gmail.com","author": "John Doe","datetime":"2017-07-30T06:48:26.765Z"}],"tags":["fashion","kylie","marketing","strategy"]},

Mercedes-Benz has begun its own car-share service that adopts that approach â€“ Croove, a platform that has now launched as a pilot in Munich, Germany.\n\nCroove is pure peer-to-peer car rental model, where renters use an app to make choices about what model, trim level and other options theyâ€™re looking for in a car. The app will poll its database of registered vehicle owners in the area and find out whatâ€™s available for the time and duration need by the renter, and connect the dots. Mercedes isnâ€™t limiting what kind of cars can be on the platform â€“ itâ€™s available to all makes of cars, with the limitation being that the car is in good condition, and isnâ€™t older than 15 years.\n\nMercedes-Benz owner Daimler is no stranger to car sharing; the company owns and operates Car2Go, a shared vehicle platform where it offers a fleet of Smart and Mercedes vehicles to members who use them on an as-needed basis and pay only for the time they drive. This is a very different approach, however, and notable for being automaker agnostic.\n\nTypically youâ€™d expect carmakers to want to use a service like this to promote its own vehicles, and indeed thatâ€™s how theyâ€™ve approach services like Zipcar in the past â€“ as a showroom or test ride opportunity for casual drivers who might consider a purchase later on. GMâ€™s Maven has that as one of its explicit service goals, in fact.\n\nCroove is much more like its independent competitors, however; Turo, which just launched in the UK, does the same thing, connecting car owners with renters regardless of vehicle type, and others like easyCar Club in Europe are doing the same.\n\nThe decision to open up the platform might just be about making sure Mercedes-Benz can accrue enough data about the pilot to judge whether this is a worthwhile effort for expansion using its own cars, but itâ€™s more likely that the carmaker is not treating this primarily as lead-generation for vehicle sales. Instead, like other automakers making more serious investments in alternative transportation models, Mercedes seems to be focused more on what comes next for automakers when selling cars to people might not be their primary business.\n\nCar sharing also becomes something that Mercedes-Benz and other carmakers can use as a purchase incentive, however â€“ almost like an alternative form of financing, which can be used to help defray the cost of ownership. Even if Croove is open to all vehicles, itâ€™d be relatively easy for Mercedes to use it as a sales push by showing how much a potential vehicle buyer could potentially earn back towards their lease or finance payments by also renting their car out occasionally on the platform.","username":"xyz@gmail.com","author":"zeeshan ahmed","comments":[],"tags":["strategy","marketing"]},

Nvidia and Mercedes-Benz are also setting an ambitious timeline for their goal; the two will field this new vehicle within the next 12 months, Nvidia confirmed to TechCrunch.\n\nThe news came out on stage at a talk between Mercedes-Benz VP of Digital Vehicle and Mobility Sajjad Khan, and Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jen-Hsun Huang on Friday at CES. Itâ€™s the result of a project the two began together three years ago, which helps explain why the car will be ready to get to customers by 2018.\n\nMercedes and Nvidia have been working together with a specific focus on deep learning and AI. Nvidia announced additional AI features powered by its in-car computing at its keynote earlier in the week at CES. These include Co-Pilot, which is a system that combines facial recognition, gaze tracking and more to help assist human drivers as a way to increase safety ahead of the advent of true autonomous driving on the roads.\n\nCo-Pilot also uses voice recognition, and a vehicleâ€™s external sensors to track objects outside the car including other vehicles and pedestrians, and can give the driver a headâ€™s up if it also detects they might not be aware of potential road danger.\n\nItâ€™s not yet clear how the AI integration will work in the Mercedes-Benz vehicle, and whether it will be a version of Co-Pilot or something else, but Nvidia tells TechCrunch it will provide more details leading up to the launch.","username":"xyz2@gmail.com","author":"Inaya N","comments":[],"tags":["technology","strategy"]}
